{"id":9167,"name":"Upload a new user into LinkedIn Matched Audiences from a new deal in HubSpot CRM","description":"This template regularly checks for new deals in HubSpot CRM and uses the retrieved information to upload new users to LinkedIn Matched Audiences.\n\nWhile this template appears to be very complicated, don't be afraid - you mainly need to set up your connections.\n\nPlease note that the template will only work when there is an associated contact with your new deal. The template uses contact data of the FIRST associated contact within the deal.\n\nFor the best performance, your contacts should have these fields filled out:\n1) First name\n2) Last name\n3) Email\n\nHaving the contact associated with a company in HubSpot will also improve match rates on LinkedIn, however it's not mandatory for this template to work.\n\nThe template is scheduled to run every 15 minutes. You can change the schedule after you set up the template by clicking the clock icon on the first module.","url":"9167-upload-a-new-user-into-linkedin-matched-audiences-from-a-new-deal-in-hubspot-crm","usedApps":["hubspotcrm","builtin","util","linkedin-matched-audiences"],"usage":60}
