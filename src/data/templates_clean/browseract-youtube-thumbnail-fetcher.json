{"id":17842,"name":"BrowserAct YouTube Thumbnail Fetcher","description":"This template allows you to request YouTube thumbnails directly from Telegram. \nWhen a user sends a keyword to your bot, the workflow uses AI to refine the query and BrowserAct to run a YouTube search. The resulting data is parsed, and each video item is processed individually. The template then cleans the thumbnail URL to remove tracking parameters and prepares a pure image link. Finally, the bot sends the thumbnail back to the user along with the video title and a direct link.\n\nThis template is ideal for bots that need to preview video content quickly, content creators selecting thumbnails, research assistants, or automated media workflows. It requires a Telegram bot, a BrowserAct connection, and Make’s AI Toolkit.\n\nAll modules are preconfigured, and each step includes clear mapping and help text so you can easily adjust the logic to your needs. To use the template, simply connect your Telegram bot and BrowserAct account, then run the scenario and send a message to your bot.","url":"17842-browseract-youtube-thumbnail-fetcher","usedApps":["telegram","ai-tools","browser-act","json","builtin"],"usage":3}
