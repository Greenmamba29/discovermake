If the email status is \"valid\", it will create a new contact on LionDesk and add that contact to a campaign. It will also send a Slack message. If the contact already exists in LionDesk, it will send a Slack message. If the email status is \"invalid\", it will delete that contact from Office 365 contacts and send a Slack message.","url":"3498-create-new-liondesk-contacts-from-office-365-people-contacts-and-add-them-to-a-campaign","usedApps":["microsoft-people","zerobounce","builtin","liondesk","slack"],"usage":5}
