{"id":6207,"name":"Create candidates in BoondManager from new Google Forms responses","description":"This template periodically creates new candidates in BoondManager based on new Google Forms responses.\n\nThe template is using [this sample](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Mtt3_Lz8TBYtcWTxh5Rx_-yzkvN7ei8nGKwXxpllrug/edit) Google Form. Please make a copy and don't make any changes to our sample form. Thank you!\n\nThe template also expects that the form responses are stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.\n\nNote that BoondManager accepts \"Country\" only as full country name in French. Any other country values (such as short codes or country names not in French) will default to \"France\" value.\n\nThe template is scheduled to run every hour. You can change this after you set up the template.","url":"6207-create-candidates-in-boondmanager-from-new-google-forms-responses","usedApps":["google-forms","boondmanager"],"usage":11}
