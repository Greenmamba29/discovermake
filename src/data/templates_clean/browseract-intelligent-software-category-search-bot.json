{"id":17879,"name":"BrowserAct Intelligent Software Category Search Bot","description":"This template creates a fully automated business app recommendation bot for Telegram.\nIt starts by analyzing the user’s message with AI to determine whether the user is casually chatting or requesting a software recommendation. If a valid category is detected, BrowserAct is triggered to search G2 and extract app details such as name, company, description, pros and cons, images, and review links.\nThe extracted data is then processed by Gemini, which formats each item into a clean JSON structure compatible with the Telegram API. The workflow automatically chooses whether to send text or images based on the content type and delivers the recommendations back to the user as rich, formatted messages.\nThis template includes category detection, web automation, data extraction, AI-based formatting, and dynamic Telegram message delivery. Suitable for SaaS discovery bots and product recommendation tools.","url":"17879-browseract-intelligent-software-category-search-bot","usedApps":["telegram","ai-tools","builtin","browser-act","gemini-ai"],"usage":2}
