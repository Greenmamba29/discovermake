{"id":17932,"name":"Create or refresh Ship24 tracking results in Google Sheets","description":"Track shipments more efficiently by connecting Google Sheets with Ship24. This template scans your sheet for active tracking numbers, creates or updates Ship24 trackers, retrieves the latest shipment status, and writes the results back into your spreadsheet. It’s ideal for small fulfilment teams, marketplace operators, or anyone who wants a simple way to monitor deliveries without manual checking.\n\nThe workflow includes three main steps:\n\n1. Detect active shipments\nThe scenario searches your Google Sheet for rows that contain a tracking number and where the latest status is not “Delivered”. This ensures that only shipments still in transit are processed.\n\n2. Create a Ship24 tracker and fetch results\nFor each active row, the template calls Ship24’s “Create Tracker and Get Tracking Results” endpoint. If your sheet includes a courier code, it is passed through for improved accuracy; otherwise, Ship24 tries to automatically detect the courier.\n\n3. Update your Google Sheet\nThe scenario updates the row with the newest tracking event and the timestamp of the check, keeping your spreadsheet up to date.\n\nBefore you begin\nYour Google Sheet should include at least the following columns:\n• Tracking Number\n• Latest Status\n• Last Check\n• (Optional) Courier Code\n\nYou may rename these columns, but your scenario mappings must be updated accordingly after importing the template.\n\nThis template was created by Ship24.
