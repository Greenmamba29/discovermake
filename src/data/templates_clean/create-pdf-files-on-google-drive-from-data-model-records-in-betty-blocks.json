{"id":6180,"name":"Create PDF Files on Google Drive from data model records in Betty Blocks","description":"Periodically create PDF files on Google Drive files based on Betty Blocks records. \n\nIn this template, Make will create sample \"training certificates\" based on training attendees' information stored in Betty Blocks. \n\nAt first, the template creates temporary Google Docs documents with variable values from Betty Blocks. The documents are then recreated as PDF documents. Finally, the temporary Google Docs documents are removed from your Google Drive and only the PDF documents stay.\n\nThe template works with [this Google Docs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L937XnK0aokqFzRSvTm2EXsjkLq1It-jpUiU-6t-q9w/edit#) serving as a \"PDF template\".\n\nThe Make template also expects your data model in Betty Blocks to have these properties:\n1) First Name as text\n2) Middle Name as text\n3) Last Name as text\n4) Phone number as text\n5) Email address as text\n6) Passed as list (yes or no)\n\nThe scenario is currently configured to run every 60 minutes, If you change the schedule, you also need to appropriately change the filter after the first module.","url":"6180-create-pdf-files-on-google-drive-from-data-model-records-in-betty-blocks","usedApps":["betty-blocks","google-docs","google-drive"],"usage":52}
