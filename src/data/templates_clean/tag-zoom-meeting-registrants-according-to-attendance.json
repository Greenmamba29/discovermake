{"id":16793,"name":"Tag Zoom meeting registrants according to attendance","description":"The scenario fetches attendance data from Zoom after a meeting ends and calculates the percentage of time each participant stayed compared to the total meeting duration. Based on this, the scenario applies specific tags in KlickTipp:\n\nAttended live full – joined and stayed for at least 90% of the meeting\n\nAttended live – joined and stayed for more than 60% but less than 90% of the meeting\n\nIt supports different Zoom meetings and can process multiple participants in one run. This allows you to segment your list and run personalized follow-up sequences based on attendee engagement.\n\nThis setup is useful for online events, workshops, and live trainings where you want to track attendance behavior and trigger targeted automation according to participation level.","url":"16073-tag-joining-zoom-participants-in-klicktipp","usedApps":["zoom-user","builtin","klicktipp"],"usage":24}
