{"id":17880,"name":"BrowserAct Automated Content Translator","description":"This automation template streamlines the full process of extracting, generating, and translating technical content from any public webpage. It starts by reading URLs from Google Sheets, then uses BrowserAct to open each page and collect structured data such as titles, headings, paragraphs, and code blocks.\n\nOnce the content is extracted, Gemini formats it into a polished Markdown article by reconstructing missing code snippets, organizing sections, and improving readability. A second Gemini step translates the completed article into Spanish while preserving Markdown structure, code integrity, technical terminology, and file names.\n\nThe final translated article is written back to Google Sheets, creating a fully automated content pipeline. This template is ideal for content creators, developers, and teams who need to convert technical webpages into multilingual, ready-to-publish articles with minimal manual effort.","url":"17880-browseract-automated-content-translator","usedApps":["google-sheets","builtin","browser-act","gemini-ai"],"usage":10}
