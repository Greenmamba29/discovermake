{"id":15966,"name":"Tag Contact - KlickTipp AI Agent Tool","description":"This workflow component enables the AI-powered Telegram assistant to apply tags to contacts in KlickTipp through natural language commands. When users request tagging operations via Telegram, the AI agent interprets the request and calls this tool to instantly assign one or multiple tags to a specific contact identified by their email address.\n\nThe workflow accepts an email address and an array of tag IDs as input, allowing bulk tag application in a single operation. This streamlined process enables immediate contact segmentation and campaign triggering without manual intervention in the KlickTipp interface.\n\nPerfect for campaign enrollment, behavior tracking, segmentation updates, and automation triggers. Users can tag contacts through simple commands like \"Tag john@example.com with VIP and Newsletter\" or \"Apply webinar-attended tag to maria@example.de.\" The tool supports multiple tags simultaneously, enabling complex segmentation strategies in one action.\n\nRequires a valid KlickTipp API connection and configuration as a callable scenario within your AI agent's tool collection.\n\nResources:\nhttps://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/ai-agent-automation/","url":"15966-tag-contact-klicktipp-ai-agent-tool","usedApps":["klicktipp","scenario-service"],"usage":2}
