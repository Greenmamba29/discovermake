{"id":16122,"name":"Manage cancelled bookings from YouCanBook.me via KlickTipp","description":"This workflow component automatically processes booking cancellations from YouCanBook.me and keeps KlickTipp contacts in sync. When an appointment is canceled, the scenario captures the attendee’s details, the cancellation timestamp, and who canceled, then calls KlickTipp’s API or update the lead without creating duplicates.\n\nThe integration maps the attendee’s email or phone number (identifier), first and last name, and cancellation metadata - Cancelled at (Unix timestamp) and Cancelled by. It also applies your chosen Tag and Opt-in Process so lists and automations stay accurate.\n\nPerfect for businesses that need clean lists, precise reporting, and automated follow-ups when clients cancel appointments.\n\nRequires active YouCanBook.me and KlickTipp connections plus configured tags, opt-in processes, and custom data fields.","url":"16122-manage-cancelled-bookings-from-youcanbook-me-via-klicktipp","usedApps":["youcanbookme","klicktipp"],"usage":3}
