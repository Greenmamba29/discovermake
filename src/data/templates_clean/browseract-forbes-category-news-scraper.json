{"id":17958,"name":"BrowserAct Forbes Category News Scraper","description":"This template automates the full pipeline of news content delivery from Forbes to Telegram.\n\nThe workflow starts with a Google Sheet that defines the target category (such as innovation or business). Make iterates through the input and triggers a BrowserAct workflow to open the corresponding Forbes section, handle scrolling or pagination, and extract structured article data including headline, author, image URL, and article link.\n\nThe extracted data is parsed and processed item by item. A short delay is applied to ensure stable execution and avoid rate limits. Each article is then sent to Google Gemini AI, which rewrites and refines the headline, formats the author credit, and generates Telegram-ready content following strict output rules.\n\nA router determines the delivery format:\n– If an article includes a valid image, it is published as a photo post with a caption.\n– If no image is available, it is published as a text-only message.\n\nAll messages are sent using HTML formatting to ensure clean layout, bold headlines, and clickable links. This template is ideal for automated news curation, Telegram channel operations, media monitoring, and real-time content distribution without manual editing.","url":"17958-browseract-forbes-category-news-scraper","usedApps":["google-sheets","builtin","browser-act","json","util","gemini-ai","telegram"],"usage":4}
