{"id":6938,"name":"Add new Salesforce leads from new ChatBot users","description":"This scenario periodically checks for new ChatBot users and uses the retrieved information to create new leads in Salesforce. \n\nThe template is using \"Lead Generation Bot\" template from Chatbot. The bot is asking for name, email, company name, company size, and a purpose of the inquiry. \n\nIt's important to pay attention to the scenario schedule and to the filter configuration in the first Chatbot module - both elements need to be the same. If you schedule this scenario to run every 15 minutes then the scenario should only check new users created in the last 15 minutes.","url":"6938-add-new-salesforce-leads-from-new-chatbot-users","usedApps":["chatbot","salesforce"],"usage":52}
