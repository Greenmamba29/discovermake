{"id":6438,"name":"Send new ManyChat subscribers as conversions to Facebook Conversions API","description":"This template sends new ManyChat subscribers as conversions to Facebook Conversions API. The sent subscribers are then marked as sent in a custom field in ManyChat.\n\nThere are several prerequisites. The template expects your ManyChat account to have these custom fields:\n1) \"Email\" as text - your subscribers need to have either email or phone custom field filled out\n2) \"Phone\" as text - your subscribers need to have either email or phone custom field filled out\n3) \"Good customer\" as text - subscribers with a \"yes\" value are eligible to be sent to Facebook Conversions API. The template uses this dummy custom field to filter only for specific subscribers (\"Good customers\").\n4) \"Passed to Facebook as a conversion\" as text - this is used for storing a \"yes\" value after the subscriber is sent to Facebook Conversions API so the subscriber does not get sent to Facebook Conversions API over and over with every execution.\n\nThe template is scheduled to run at 8:00 AM every day. You can change this after you set up the template.","url":"6438-send-new-manychat-subscribers-as-conversions-to-facebook-conversions-api","usedApps":["manychat","util","facebook-conversions-api"],"usage":109}
