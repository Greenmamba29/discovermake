{"id":9127,"name":"Send an email when a campaign in Google Ads encounters a major avg. CPC change","description":"Please disable your ad blockers when working with our Google Ads apps. The ad blockers may cause unexpected behavior.\n\nThis template regularly checks for avg. CPC changes above a specified percent threshold and sends a notification email with campaign performance details.\n\nThe template first downloads the data for the last 7 days for each campaign and compares avg. CPCs from the last 2 available days which meet a minimum click threshold. Note that the template is not necessarily looking for the last 2 consecutive days but for the last 2 available days within the last 7 day period.\n\nThe template is scheduled to run every day at 9 AM. You can change the schedule after you set up the template by clicking the clock icon on the first module.","url":"9127-send-an-email-when-a-campaign-in-google-ads-encounters-a-major-avg-cpc-change","usedApps":["util","google-ads-campaign-management","builtin","json","email"],"usage":141}
