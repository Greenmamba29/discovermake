{"id":17951,"name":"BrowserAct YouTube Publishing Strategy Generator","description":"This end-to-end automation extracts YouTube channel video data, analyzes historical performance, and identifies the optimal publishing time to maximize viral potential.\n\nUsing BrowserAct, the workflow dynamically scrapes all videos from a selected channel and stores Title, URL, Views, Likes, and Published Date into Google Sheets. The data is then aggregated and sent to Gemini AI with a structured analytical prompt that examines performance by day of week, hour of day, and minute.\n\nThe AI model detects high-performing time windows, negative “dead zones,” and statistically significant publishing patterns. The final insights are automatically written back to a dedicated results sheet, aligned to the correct row, enabling fast review and action.\n\nThis template is ideal for creators, content teams, agencies, and analysts who want a repeatable, data-driven method to optimize their YouTube publishing strategy. No manual data pulling, no repetitive analysis—everything runs end-to-end with one click.","url":"17951-browseract-youtube-publishing-strategy-generator","usedApps":["google-sheets","builtin","gemini-ai","browser-act","json","util"],"usage":10}
