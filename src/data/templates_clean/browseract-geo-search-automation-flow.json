{"id":17953,"name":"BrowserAct Geo-Search Automation Flow","description":"This workflow automates local service discovery using Telegram, BrowserAct, and Gemini AI.\nWhen a user messages the bot, the system first determines whether the request is casual chat or an actual service inquiry. If the user provides both a service type and a location, the workflow continues. If not, the bot asks for missing details.\n\nOnce the request is complete, the data is passed to BrowserAct, which navigates Google Maps, scrolls through the results, extracts provider information, and returns structured JSON. The extracted results are sent to Gemini AI with a formatting prompt that converts the data into clean, HTML-ready Telegram output while respecting character limits and display rules.\n\nFinally, the formatted results are delivered back to the user in Telegram as an organized list of providers including name, rating, phone, address, and website links. This template is ideal for building intelligent service-finder assistants, lead-generation tools, or local business lookup bots.","url":"17953-browseract-geo-search-automation-flow","usedApps":["telegram","ai-tools","builtin","browser-act","gemini-ai"],"usage":2}
