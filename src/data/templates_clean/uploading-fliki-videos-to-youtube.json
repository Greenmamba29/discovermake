When a video render is completed in Fliki, the scenario triggers automatically. It then uses Google Gemini AI to generate a compelling, SEO-friendly video title based on the content. After that, it downloads the MP4 video file via an HTTP module, converting the URL into a binary buffer format suitable for YouTube. Finally, the video is uploaded directly to your YouTube channel, complete with the AI-generated title.\n\nThis setup is ideal for content creators, marketers, educators, and businesses looking to scale content publishing without manual uploading. Save time, maintain consistency, and streamline your content workflow by integrating text-to-video AI tools with your YouTube channel.\n\nSet it once, and let your videos go live as soon as they’re ready.","url":"16043-uploading-fliki-videos-to-youtube","usedApps":["fliki","gemini-ai","http","youtube"],"usage":1164}
