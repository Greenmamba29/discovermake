{"id":17859,"name":"Curate Hackernews, Make a brief audio news and Delivery to Telegram","description":"This template automates a full “news curation → AI briefing → audio generation → Telegram delivery” workflow.\nIt begins by requesting the Hacker News top-stories list and slicing the first 30 IDs. Each ID is iterated to fetch detailed items such as title and URL. The aggregator then collects all fetched stories into a single array, forming the dataset used in the AI prompt.\n\nAn OpenAI Chat Completion module receives the full list of stories and a predefined set of user interests. It produces a JSON output containing:\n\na newsroom-style briefing summarizing the most relevant items, written to be TTS-friendly, and\n\nan array of selected stories with their title and URL.\nThe module’s text output is parsed into structured JSON for later processing.\n\nThe scenario then branches into two routes.\nRoute 1 composes a textual summary listing the chosen items, aggregates them into a single formatted string, and sends the message to a Telegram chat.\nRoute 2 uses the briefing text to generate Korean speech via Typecast. The produced audio file is then sent to the same Telegram channel with a daily timestamped filename.\n\nAll steps are fully automated, require no manual input, and run on demand. Variables and aggregators ensure that multiple items are processed correctly, while the router enables simultaneous text and audio delivery. The result is a compact, reliable workflow for receiving personalized Hacker News briefings directly in Telegram.","url":"17859-curate-hackernews-make-a-brief-audio-news-and-delivery-to-telegram","usedApps":["http","util","builtin","openai-gpt-3","json","telegram","typecast"],"usage":1}
