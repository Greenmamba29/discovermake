{"id":15953,"name":"Contact Creator - KlickTipp AI Agent Tool","description":"This workflow component enables the AI-powered Telegram assistant to create or update KlickTipp contacts through natural language commands. When users request contact operations via Telegram, the AI agent interprets the request and calls this tool to instantly add new contacts or update existing ones with comprehensive profile information.\n\nThe workflow accepts email or phone number as the primary identifier along with extensive contact details including personal information, address data, phone numbers, and custom fields. If a contact with the provided email already exists, the system intelligently updates their information rather than creating duplicates. It returns the complete contact data for confirmation and subsequent operations.\n\nPerfect for lead capture, contact enrichment, event registration, and customer data management. Users can add contacts with full details through simple commands like \"Add contact john@example.com, John Smith from Berlin\" or \"Update Maria's phone number to +49123456789.\" The tool supports standard fields like name, company, and address, plus custom fields for integrations with Calendly, Stripe, WhatsApp, and other platforms.\n\nRequires a valid KlickTipp API connection and configuration as a callable scenario within your AI agent's tool collection.","url":"15953-klicktipp-contact-creator-ai-agent-tool","usedApps":["klicktipp","scenario-service"],"usage":4}
