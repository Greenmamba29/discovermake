{"id":5839,"name":"Create a Revolut Business draft payment for shipping and send a Slack notification from a new WooCommerce order","description":"Use this template to create a Revolut draft payment to a courier and send a Slack notification once a WooCommerce order is created.\n\nThe setup of the template assumes you have your shipping and courier data stored in 2 separate Google Sheets. Sheet #1 has to include these columns: Country, Name of the courier, Shipping fee. Sheet #2 has to include these columns: Name of the courier and payment details. \n\nTo see which details are required to create a Revolut draft payment depending on the country, click [here](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/build-banking-apps/#tutorials-tutorials-work-with-draft-payments-international-payments). For example, if you're creating a payment to the United Kingdom, your Sheet #2 (the one with the courier information) needs to include an Account Number and a Sort Code; for payment to Germany, it's IBAN and BIC.","url":"5839-create-a-revolut-business-draft-payment-for-shipping-and-send-a-slack-notification-from-a-new-woocommerce-order","usedApps":["woocommerce","google-sheets","revolut","slack"],"usage":7}
