{"id":16230,"name":"Sync new Gmail emails to your Noloco app","description":"Automatically create a new record in your Noloco app whenever a new email lands in your Gmail inbox. This template is perfect for keeping a searchable archive of important emails alongside your existing data — whether for client communications, support, or deal tracking.\n\nThe workflow connects Gmail with Noloco, and adds each new email as a record in a table (e.g., “Emails”). You can customize which fields are saved — such as subject, sender, date, and message body — to suit your needs.\n\nBefore using this template:\nMake sure your Noloco app has a table to store the emails. We recommend calling it Emails, with fields like Subject, From, Date, and Body. If you don’t have this yet, Noloco AI can help you generate it instantly.\n\nThis template was created by Noloco.\nFor help getting started, visit guides.noloco.io or contact us through our in-app support.","url":"16230-sync-new-gmail-emails-to-your-noloco-app","usedApps":["google-email","noloco"],"usage":2}
