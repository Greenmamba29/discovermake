{"id":7072,"name":"Create new PDF documents in Google Drive from new items in Monday","description":"This template periodically checks for new items in Monday and uses the retrieved items' information to create new templated PDF documents in Google Drive. \n\nThe template expects your Monday board to have these columns besides the default ones:\n1) Note as text\n2) Email as text\n3) Phone number as number\n\nIf your column set is different, you will need to spend a bit more time on template configuration. We recommend to setup a test board with the needed columns, go through the template configuration, and run the saved scenario once. After you succeed, you should be able to edit the scenario to fit your business needs with data from a real Monday board and with a real Google Docs template.\n\nThe template is using [this sample](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NtqdUlWer9hYyNr4VnMBNQAZxKSCB3rgHJX2CxU96WM/edit?usp=sharing) Google Docs template as the source for creating the final PDFs. \n\nThe template is scheduled to run every 15 minutes. You can change the schedule after you set up the template.\n","url":"7072-create-new-pdf-documents-in-google-drive-from-new-items-in-monday","usedApps":["monday","google-docs","google-drive"],"usage":369}
