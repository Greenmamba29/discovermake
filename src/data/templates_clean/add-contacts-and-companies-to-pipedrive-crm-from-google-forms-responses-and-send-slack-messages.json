{"id":3433,"name":"Add contacts and companies to Pipedrive CRM from Google Forms responses and send Slack messages","description":"Every time a Google Forms response is submitted, Make will automatically check for the status of the email in ZeroBounce. If the status of the email is valid, it will get the person's details with Clearbit , create a new person in PipeDrive CRM, and send a Slack message. If there is a domain for the company that the person works for, Make will get that company's data with Clearbit, create a new organization in Pipedrive CRM, and send a Slack message. This example uses the responses in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KytET6Ql0u9ogzaERz24YrLQEusOn7Iwa8dN6B0dFNY/edit#gid=964126193),","url":"3433-add-contacts-and-companies-to-pipedrive-crm-from-google-forms-responses-and-send-slack-messages","usedApps":["google-forms","zerobounce","clearbit","builtin","pipedrive","slack"],"usage":19}
