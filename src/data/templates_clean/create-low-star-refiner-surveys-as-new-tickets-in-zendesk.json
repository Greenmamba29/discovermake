{"id":6220,"name":"Create low star Refiner surveys as new tickets in Zendesk","description":"This template adds a new ticket into Zendesk as soon as a new low star response is collected by Refiner.\n\nWhile setting up the template, you need to take a generated webhook URL from Make and use it in Integrations>Webhooks in the Refiner UI.\n\nThe template expects your Refiner survey to have these questions:\n1) How likely are you to recommend our service a friend or colleague? (as an NPS score question)\n2) What do you value you most about our service? (as an open question)\n3) How many starts would you give us? (as a star rating question)\n\nNote that email values from Refiner will only be passed to Zendesk if they are available for the particular survey submission.","url":"6220-create-low-star-refiner-surveys-as-new-tickets-in-zendesk","usedApps":["refiner","zendesk"],"usage":0}
