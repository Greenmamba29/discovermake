The final PDF documents are then saved to a folder in Google Drive.\n\nThe template is using [this sample](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NHI-TeXEwrUMZ0PfCxriXhB9klvZ1zd-UBe8wXUfj0w/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheets spreadsheet. You should make a copy of it before configuring the template.\n\nThe template also expects your PDF Generator API document template to have a \"Name\" and a \"DueDate\" field.\n\nThe template is scheduled to run every 15 minutes.
