{"id":10935,"name":"Create a purchase order and a Revolut draft payment when Zoho inventory falls below certain level","description":"Use this template to create a purchase order from a Google Docs template, send it over in an Email and create a Revolut Business draft payment when Zoho inventory reaches a certain level.\n\nThe Make template works with this Google Docs [purchase order template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TnppGiTfU1DkIDrm3HS7oOJ0NIv7yTMBC9uiKgmnkEM/edit?usp=sharing). You can create your own Google Docs template - use {{ }} brackets for the text you want to replace with items from Airtable fields (more on that below).\n\nThe setup of the template assumes you have your supplier data stored in an Airtable table. If you're using above linked Google Docs template your Airtable table has to include these fields: Name of the supplier (First name and Last name if the supplier is an individual), Supplier's email address, Supplier's address (separate fields for Street address, City and Postal Code), Quantity you want to purchase, Zoho Inventory item ID and payment details.\n\nTo see which details are required to create a Revolut draft payment depending on the country, click [here](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/build-banking-apps/#tutorials-tutorials-work-with-draft-payments-international-payments). For example, if you're creating a payment to the United Kingdom, your Airtable table needs to include an Account Number and a Sort Code; for payment to Germany, it's IBAN and BIC.\n","url":"5843-create-a-purchase-order-and-a-revolut-draft-payment-when-zoho-inventory-falls-below-certain-level","usedApps":["zoho-inventory","airtable","util","google-docs","email","revolut"],"usage":24}
