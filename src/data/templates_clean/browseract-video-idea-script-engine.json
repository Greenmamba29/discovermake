{"id":17877,"name":"BrowserAct Video Idea & Script Engine","description":"This template turns your Telegram bot into an automated YouTube content generator. When a user requests a video script, the workflow identifies the intent, generates a relevant search keyword, and sends it to BrowserAct to collect real YouTube data such as titles, descriptions, comments, and transcripts.\n\nThe collected data is passed to Google Gemini, which analyzes audience interest and content patterns to create an original video idea and a complete, timestamped script. The final script is saved directly into Google Sheets, and the user receives a confirmation message automatically.\n\nThis template is ideal for creators, marketers, and agencies who want fast, research-backed video concepts without manual effort. No technical skills required—just message your bot, and the workflow does the rest.","url":"17877-browseract-video-idea-script-engine","usedApps":["telegram","ai-tools","builtin","browser-act","gemini-ai","google-sheets"],"usage":5}
