{"id":18045,"name":"Add an online form as interactive attachment to a card - vPlan","description":"Easily attach an interactive online form to a card in vPlan. This template allows you to link external forms—such as Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, or Typeform—directly to a vPlan card, making the form accessible as an interactive link within the card.\n\nThis setup is ideal for collecting structured input directly from the planning context, such as measurement data, approval requests, or hour registrations. The scenario is configured in a simple, ready-to-use way and can be extended with additional logic, validation, or form providers to fit your workflow. By embedding forms at the card level, you streamline data collection and keep all relevant information connected to your vPlan process.","url":"18045-add-an-online-form-as-attachment-to-a-card-vplan","usedApps":["vplan","vplan"],"usage":1}
