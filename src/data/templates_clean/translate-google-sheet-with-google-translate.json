{"id":5490,"name":"Translate Google Sheet with Google Translate","description":"With this scenario you can create a bilingual content in Google sheet. Have the original text in column A and Make will use Google Translate and add the translated to text to column B of the same Google Sheet file. Every time you add new rows, Make will pick them up (within scheduled intervals) and translate them. In this scenario, we use a Google sheet with a header in the first row with the 'source' in column A and a target language code in column B.","url":"5490-translate-google-sheet-with-google-translate","usedApps":["google-sheets","google-translate","regexp"],"usage":163}
