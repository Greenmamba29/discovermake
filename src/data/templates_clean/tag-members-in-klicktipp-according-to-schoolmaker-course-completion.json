{"id":17668,"name":"Tag members in KlickTipp according to Schoolmaker course completion","description":"This automation connects SchoolMaker and KlickTipp to keep your contact tagging always aligned with the latest course completions.\n\nWhen a member finishes a course in SchoolMaker, the scenario is triggered by a webhook that listens for completion events. It captures the member’s email and program name, then routes the flow based on the course completed.\n\nThe router checks the program name and applies the appropriate tag in KlickTipp.\n\nWith this setup, your KlickTipp database stays current with each learner’s progress, making it easy to automate post-course emails, issue certificates, or move graduates into new marketing sequences automatically.","url":"17668-tag-members-in-klicktipp-according-to-schoolmaker-course-completion","usedApps":["schoolmaker","builtin","klicktipp"],"usage":2}
