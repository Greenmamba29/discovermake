{"id":4957,"name":"Create a Slack message with a list of completed Asana tasks","description":"With this template, you will get a Slack message with a list of completed Asana tasks.\n\nThe template is set to send an overview of today's completed tasks (i.e. once a day). You can schedule the scenario to run as you need but adjust the first filter (\"Completed since\") in the first module accordingly. For example, if it runs every 12 hours, only tasks completed in the last 12 hours should be listed.","url":"4957-create-a-slack-message-with-a-list-of-completed-asana-tasks","usedApps":["asana","util","slack"],"usage":52}
