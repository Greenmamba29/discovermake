{"id":7775,"name":"Start Verification using Twilio Verify","description":"With this automation, you can verify a phone number; this is mainly used for identification purposes. For example, this allows authenticating users that want to authenticate using their phone number. Once they enter their phone number, an SMS is sent to their phone containing a verification code. In order for the user to authenticate, the user is asked to enter the code received with the SMS. Once the user submits the code, the automation authenticates the code. If the code is valid, you can redirect the user to the desired location. If the code is invalid, the automation repeats itself and sends another verification code.","url":"7775-start-verification-using-twilio-verify","usedApps":["gateway","builtin","twilio-verify"],"usage":142}
