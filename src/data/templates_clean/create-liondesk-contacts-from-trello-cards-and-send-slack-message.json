{"id":3501,"name":"Create LionDesk contacts from Trello cards and send Slack message","description":"Every time a new Trello card is created, Make will automatically validate the email in the card with ZeroBounce. If the email status is \"valid\" it will get that person's data using Clearbit and create a new contact in LionDesk. It will then send a Slack message. If the contact already exists or no result is returned from Clearbit it will send a Slack message.","url":"3501-create-liondesk-contacts-from-trello-cards-and-send-slack-message","usedApps":["trello","zerobounce","clearbit","liondesk","slack"],"usage":4}
