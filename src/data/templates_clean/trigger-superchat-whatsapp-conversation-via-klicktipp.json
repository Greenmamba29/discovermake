{"id":14631,"name":"Trigger Superchat WhatsApp Conversation via KlickTipp","description":"This scenario watches for a tag applied to a contact in KlickTipp (and can also be triggered by a campaign) and emits an outbound event to Make. Make then sends a predefined WhatsApp template to the contact using your custom variables. You can map contact fields to template variables such as Name, Time and Product/Service to deliver personalized appointment reminders or webinar invitations. \n\nWhen a contact replies on WhatsApp, SuperChat detects the incoming message and routes the conversation to your support agents for manual follow-up. This ensures every reply is handled by a real person without any extra configuration.\n\nIdeal for coaches, consultants, trainers and digital product creators who want to engage leads where they already chat, this integration removes manual steps, boosts engagement with timely, relevant reminders and gives you full control over automated and manual messaging—all from within KlickTipp and Make.","url":"14631-klicktipp-superchat-whatsapp-template-automation","usedApps":["klicktipp","superchat"],"usage":20}
