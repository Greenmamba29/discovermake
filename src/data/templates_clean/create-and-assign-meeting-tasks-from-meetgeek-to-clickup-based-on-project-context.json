{"id":16669,"name":"Create and assign meeting tasks from MeetGeek to ClickUp based on project context","description":"Automatically detect tasks discussed during meetings using OpenAI, assign them to the right team members, and organize them in the correct ClickUp project and folder.\n\nThis Make template connects meeting tools (like MeetGeek or any webhook-compatible source) with OpenAI to extract task details, assignees, and due dates from meeting transcripts. The AI identifies who’s responsible for each task using participant emails or defaults to the meeting host. It also determines which project and list in ClickUp the task belongs to based on meeting context and folder IDs.\n\nIf assignee or folder information is unclear, fallback logic ensures tasks still get created and can be reassigned later. This allows teams to save time, reduce manual entry, and keep ClickUp project spaces automatically updated after every meeting.\n\n🔧 Apps used: MeetGeek (or webhook input), OpenAI, ClickUp\n📦 Features: dynamic task creation, assignee mapping, fallback logic, project/folder routing\n\nThis template was created by MeetGeek.\nQuestions?
