{"id":15936,"name":"Tag Creator - KlickTipp AI Agent Tool","description":"This workflow component enables the AI-powered Telegram assistant to dynamically create new tags in KlickTipp through natural language commands. When users request tag creation via Telegram messages, the AI agent interprets the request and calls this tool to instantly generate custom tags with optional descriptions.\nThe workflow accepts tag name and description parameters from the AI agent, creates the tag in your KlickTipp account, and returns the newly generated tag ID for confirmation and further operations. This seamless integration allows for on-the-fly tag management without accessing the KlickTipp interface.\n\nPerfect for campaign preparation, dynamic segmentation, event management, and customer categorization. Users can create campaign-specific tags, location-based segments, or customer categories through simple commands like \"Create a tag called BlackFriday2025\" or \"Make a new tag for Berlin workshop attendees.\"\n\nThis extends the AI assistant's capabilities by allowing real-time tag creation based on business needs. Marketing teams can adapt their segmentation strategy instantly without interrupting their workflow. When combined with other KlickTipp AI tools, it enables powerful automation sequences through simple Telegram commands.\nRequires a valid KlickTipp API connection and configuration as a callable scenario within your AI agent's tool collection.","url":"15934-klicktipp-tag-creator-ai-agent-tool","usedApps":["klicktipp","scenario-service"],"usage":4}
