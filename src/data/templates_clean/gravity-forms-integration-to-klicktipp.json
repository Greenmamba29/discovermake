{"id":14785,"name":"Gravity Forms Integration to KlickTipp","description":"This scenario listens for new submissions from a specified Gravity Form and automatically creates a new contact in KlickTipp. It maps user inputs such as first name, last name, email address, mobile number, birthday, LinkedIn profile URL, webinar date, rating and feedback comments into the corresponding contact fields in your KlickTipp account. The integration applies data transformation rules to ensure that dates follow the correct format and that numeric responses are converted into the appropriate type before they reach your contact database.\n\nWith this template in place, you can segment contacts based on the timing of their webinar participation and the qualitative insights they provide in their feedback. You can trigger personalized follow-up sequences such as thank-you emails, satisfaction surveys or invitations to upcoming events. This level of automation allows you to deliver timely and highly targeted marketing messages without any manual data handling.","url":"14785-gravity-forms-to-klicktipp-integration","usedApps":["gravity-forms","klicktipp"],"usage":8}
