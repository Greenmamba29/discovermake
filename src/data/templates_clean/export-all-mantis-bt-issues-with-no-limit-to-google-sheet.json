If you're unable to get all your records in that time, set the Repeater's \"Initial value\" to start after the last page you've received and run the scenario again. When no more records are returned, the scenario will stop.","url":"7284-export-all-mantis-bt-issues-with-no-limit-to-google-sheet","usedApps":["builtin","mantisbt","google-sheets"],"usage":5}
