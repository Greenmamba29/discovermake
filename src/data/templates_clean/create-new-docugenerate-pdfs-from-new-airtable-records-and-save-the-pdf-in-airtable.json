{"id":16638,"name":"Create new DocuGenerate PDFs from new Airtable records and save the PDF in Airtable","description":"Every time a new record is added to an Airtable base, Make will automatically generate a PDF document using DocuGenerate and attach it back to the original record. This creates a complete workflow where your generated documents are stored directly within your Airtable database. This example uses a sample base to generate professional PDF certificates, similar to our [Airtable scripting extension tutorial](https://www.docugenerate.com/blog/generate-documents-from-airtable-using-a-scripting-extension/?utm_source=make&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=template_16552). \nYou can easily customize this workflow with your own templates and Airtable base structure. \nCreated by DocuGenerate.
