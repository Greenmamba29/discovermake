{"id":9171,"name":"Upload a new user into LinkedIn Matched Audiences from a new deal in ActiveCampaign","description":"This template regularly checks for new deals in ActiveCampaign and uses the retrieved information to upload new users into LinkedIn Matched Audiences.\n\nWhile this template appears to be very complicated, don't be afraid - you mainly need to set up your connections.\n\nPlease note that the template will only work when there is an associated contact with your new deal. \n\nFor the best performance, your contacts should have these fields filled out:\n1) First name\n2) Last name\n3) Email\n\nHaving the deal associated with an account in ActiveCampaign will also improve match rates on LinkedIn, however it's not mandatory for this template to work.\n\nThe template is scheduled to run every 15 minutes. You can change the schedule after you set up the template by clicking the clock icon on the first module.","url":"9171-upload-a-new-user-into-linkedin-matched-audiences-from-a-new-deal-in-activecampaign","usedApps":["activecampaign","builtin","util","linkedin-matched-audiences"],"usage":15}
