{"id":17890,"name":"Get or create tag IDs in KlickTipp from an array of tag names","description":"This scenario takes an array of tag names and ensures that every one of them exists in your KlickTipp account. It automatically compares the provided names with your existing tags, retrieves the IDs of matches, and creates new tags when needed — returning a clean, unified list of tag IDs with no duplicates or manual work.\n\nPerfect for marketers, automation builders, and CRM managers who want to maintain consistent tagging structures across their automations. Whether you’re syncing data from e-commerce, webinars, forms, or external APIs, this scenario guarantees that every tag referenced in your workflows actually exists in KlickTipp.\n\nAll IDs — existing and newly created — are then aggregated into a single array, which you can directly use in your automations to tag contacts, segment audiences, or trigger behavior-based sequences.\n\nWith this automated flow, your workflows stay clean, reliable, and fully synchronized with your KlickTipp tagging system — without ever needing to create tags manually again.","url":"17890-get-or-create-tags-in-klicktipp","usedApps":["scenario-service","klicktipp","builtin","util"],"usage":4}
