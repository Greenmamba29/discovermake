{"id":5909,"name":"Create a Revolut draft payment from a new Asana task","description":"Use this template to automatically create a Revolut Business draft payment when a new Asana task is created.\n\nThe setup of the template assumes that the name of the recipient of the payment is used as a name for the Asana task and the amount to be sent is used as a description of the task. Additionally, your recipients' data have to be stored in an Airtable table. Your table has to include these fields: Name of the recipient (first name and last name) and payment details.\n\nTo see which details are required to create a Revolut draft payment depending on the country, click [here](https://developer.revolut.com/docs/build-banking-apps/#tutorials-tutorials-work-with-draft-payments-international-payments). For example, if you're creating a payment to the United Kingdom, your Airtable table needs to include an Account Number and a Sort Code; for payment to Germany, it's IBAN and BIC.","url":"5909-create-a-revolut-draft-payment-from-a-new-asana-task","usedApps":["asana","airtable","revolut"],"usage":2}
