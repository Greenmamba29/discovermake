{"id":6394,"name":"Weekly overview of JIRA Cloud Platform issues in Notion","description":"Automatically create weekly JIRA Cloud Platform reports and add them to a Notion database. This integration consists of 2 parts (routes). \n\nThe first one creates a Notion database item (page) with data grouped by Jira issue status (i.e. how many issues have been *Done* in the current week, how many are *In Progress* and *To Do*). \n\nThe second part creates a more detailed overview and groups data by assignee and status. The overview is appended to the database item (page) as page content. Please note that the Notion API limit for the text page content is 2000 characters.\n\nSee our [database](https://www.notion.so/0648173952b84fe193b4452b76af5adc?v=6e6d0b320a1449d68b3f4576e7fa788d) for reference.\n\nThe scenario is scheduled to run every Friday at 16:00. You can change it by clicking the clock icon on the first module. Make sure it's set to run the same week you want to retrieve the report for.","url":"6394-weekly-overview-of-jira-cloud-platform-issues-in-notion","usedApps":["notion","jira","builtin","util"],"usage":116}
