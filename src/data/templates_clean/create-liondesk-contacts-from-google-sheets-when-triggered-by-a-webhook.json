{"id":3549,"name":"Create LionDesk contacts from Google Sheets when triggered by a Webhook","description":"Every time a custom webhook is triggered, Make will automatically use the email output from the webhook to add a new row to a Google Sheet. It will then validate that email address using ZeroBounce. If the email status is \"valid\" it will look that person up with Clearbit and create a new contact in LionDesk. It will also update the Google Sheet  row with the new data.","url":"3549-create-liondesk-contacts-from-google-sheets-when-triggered-by-a-webhook","usedApps":["gateway","google-sheets","zerobounce","clearbit","liondesk"],"usage":7}
