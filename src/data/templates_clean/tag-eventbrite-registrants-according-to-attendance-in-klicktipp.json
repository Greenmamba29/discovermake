{"id":17317,"name":"Tag Eventbrite registrants according to attendance in KlickTipp","description":"This template connects Eventbrite with KlickTipp to automatically tag attendees based on their actual participation and refund status. When attendees are pulled from an Eventbrite event, the automation routes them according to their check-in data:\n\nAttended: Tagged as “Participated” in KlickTipp.\n\nDid not attend: Tagged as “Not Participated.”\n\nRefunded: Tagged as “Refundee,” regardless of attendance status.\n\nBy applying these tags, you can segment contacts for personalized post-event communication, nurture sequences, or targeted offers. For example, you might thank participants with exclusive materials, re-engage non-attendees with replay access, and handle refundees appropriately.\n\nThis ensures every registrant is clearly segmented, reducing manual work and improving the relevance of your event follow-ups.\n\nResources:","url":"17317-tag-eventbrite-registrants-according-to-attendance-in-klicktipp","usedApps":["eventbrite","builtin","klicktipp"],"usage":2}
