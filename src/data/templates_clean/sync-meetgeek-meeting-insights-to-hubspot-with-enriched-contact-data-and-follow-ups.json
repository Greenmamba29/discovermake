{"id":16023,"name":"Sync MeetGeek meeting insights to HubSpot with enriched contact data and follow-ups","description":"Automatically enrich contact and company information, sync it to HubSpot, and generate AI-powered follow-up tasks—all based on your MeetGeek meeting data.\n\nThis Make template uses MeetGeek, OpenAI, and HubSpot to streamline post-meeting sales workflows. It starts by pulling meeting participant emails and uses a Make AI agent to enrich contact and company details via Apollo and web search. The AI then returns clean JSON to create or update records in HubSpot (contacts, companies, and deals).\n\nYou can also pass the meeting transcript to OpenAI to determine whether a follow-up is needed. If so, the workflow will auto-create a task with a recommended summary and assign it to the right person—based on email matching, fallback logic, or manual mapping.\n\n🔧 Apps used: MeetGeek, OpenAI, HubSpot\n⚙️ Key features: contact enrichment, CRM syncing, intelligent follow-up task generation\n\nThis template was created by MeetGeek.\n💬 For support, reach out to support@meetgeek.ai.\n🎥 Watch this video to learn how to set it up: https://youtu.be/BVSyOXUBrD8?si=aVbDHpRPtDVuXLIQ&t=1935","url":"16023-sync-meetgeek-meeting-insights-to-hubspot-with-enriched-contact-data-and-follow-ups","usedApps":["meetgeekai","util","ai-agent","openai-gpt-3","hubspotcrm","builtin","google-docs"],"usage":8}
