{"id":17851,"name":"BrowserAct AI-Powered Designer Matcher","description":"This template automates the process of discovering and evaluating top design talent on Dribbble.\n\nIt collects the user's hiring requirements directly from Telegram—such as the desired skill, target location, and maximum budget. The workflow then passes these inputs into a BrowserAct automation that searches Dribbble, extracts designer profiles, and intelligently filters results based on the user’s criteria.\n\nAfter processing, the template formats the designer information and sends it back to the Telegram chat in a clean and readable format. It supports structured outputs, automated data parsing, and optional Google Sheets logging for later review.\n\nThis template is ideal for recruiters, founders, hiring managers, or anyone looking to quickly find qualified designers without manually browsing Dribbble. Fully automated, fast to deploy, and beginner-friendly.\n","url":"17851-browseract-ai-powered-designer-matcher","usedApps":["telegram","ai-tools","builtin","util","browser-act","json","google-sheets"],"usage":1}
