The finished article is written back to the same row in the sheet. This template is ideal for creating large batches of movie articles quickly, with no manual copying or formatting required.","url":"17866-browseract-movie-article-builder","usedApps":["google-sheets","builtin","browser-act","gemini-ai"],"usage":3}
