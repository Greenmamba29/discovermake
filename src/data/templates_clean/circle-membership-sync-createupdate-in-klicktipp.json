{"id":17766,"name":"Circle Membership Sync: Create/Update in KlickTipp","description":"This automation template creates a complete onboarding bridge between Circle and KlickTipp. It listens for newly added members in your Circle community and checks in KlickTipp whether the contact already exists. If the contact is not found, the system automatically creates or updates the record in KlickTipp, adding them to a predefined opt-in process and applying the dedicated \"Subscribe via invite\" tag. It also captures and stores the Circle signup timestamp for accurate lead tracking and segmentation.\n\nFor contacts who already exist in KlickTipp, the automation applies an additional tag indicating that the member has accepted their Circle invitation. This enables you to run targeted follow-up sequences, track invite engagement, and manage onboarding funnels based on member behavior.\n\nThe result is a fully automated synchronization flow: new members get added to your email list, existing contacts are enriched with behavioral tags, and your community data remains clean and structured. Ideal for community-led funnels, coaching programs, digital memberships, and any Circle-based experience where automated email nurturing and segmentation in KlickTipp are essential.","url":"17766-circle-membership-sync-create-update-in-klicktipp","usedApps":["circle-so","klicktipp"],"usage":2}
