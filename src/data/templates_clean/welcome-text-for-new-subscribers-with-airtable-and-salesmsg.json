{"id":12995,"name":"Welcome text for new subscribers with Airtable and Salesmsg","description":"New subscribers are joining your list. How are you welcoming them?\n\nMost businesses rely on a welcome email. But, did you know that texts have an average open rate that's 5x higher than email (98% vs. 20%)? This means subscribers are far more likely to see your text message.\n\nWith a welcome text message, you can:\n\nConnect with new subscribers and make them feel valued from day #1.\n\nSet expectations for what they can expect from your emails, blog, newsletter or podcast.\n\nGive them an exclusive welcome offer that's only available via text.\n\nEven invite them to text back and ask you questions or give comments.\n\nWith this one-step automation from Salesmsg, you’ll automatically text your new subscribers at the moment when they’re most engaged—on the day they join your list.\n\nA 3rd party created this template and it has not been tested by Make.
