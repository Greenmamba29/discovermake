{"id":17509,"name":"Transfer Wix orders to KlickTipp with conditional Tagging","description":"This scenario listens for new orders in Wix and automatically creates or updates contacts in KlickTipp. Order details such as customer name, email address, products purchased, and total order value are mapped directly into your KlickTipp account without any manual steps. Dynamic information from each purchase enriches contact profiles, giving you the power to segment and personalize communication effortlessly.\n\nPerfect for e-commerce businesses, online retailers, and digital shops that want to eliminate manual data entry and ensure every buyer is followed up with the right messages. Customers are tagged in real time, so you can immediately launch thank-you messages, upsell campaigns, or loyalty sequences tailored to their orders.\n\nYou can assign both fixed and conditional tags based on order criteria. For example, high-value orders over 100 can be tagged as Premium Customer, while purchases containing clothing SKUs receive a Clothing Buyer tag. These tags feed directly into your KlickTipp campaigns, helping you build targeted sequences, loyalty programs, and product-specific promotions.\n\nWith this seamless flow, your database stays clean, organized, and always up to date — reflecting exactly what your customers bought and how valuable they are to your business.","url":"17509-transfer-wix-orders-to-klicktipp-with-conditional-tagging","usedApps":["wix","klicktipp","builtin"],"usage":1}
