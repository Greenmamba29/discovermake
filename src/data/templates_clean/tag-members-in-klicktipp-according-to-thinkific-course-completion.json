{"id":17637,"name":"Tag members in KlickTipp according to Thinkific course completion","description":"This scenario connects Thinkific with KlickTipp to automate tagging when a student completes a course.\n\nOnce a Thinkific user finishes a course, the scenario is triggered and routes the data based on the completed course. The student is then tagged in KlickTipp with the corresponding course completion tag, making it easy to send targeted follow-ups, certificates, or next-step offers.\n\nThis automation keeps your contact segmentation up to date and ensures that every completed course automatically triggers the right post-learning communication.\n\nYou can expand this scenario to support additional courses or connect it with further automations such as feedback requests, advanced course promotions, or membership upgrades.","url":"17637-tag-members-in-klicktipp-according-to-thinkific-course-completion","usedApps":["thinkific","builtin","klicktipp"],"usage":2}
