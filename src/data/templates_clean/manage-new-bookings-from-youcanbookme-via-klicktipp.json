{"id":16120,"name":"Manage new bookings from YouCanBook.me via KlickTipp","description":"This workflow component automatically processes new bookings from YouCanBook.me and creates or updates corresponding contacts in KlickTipp. When a new appointment is scheduled, the system captures booking details such as attendee information, start and end times, and meeting link, then syncs them to KlickTipp with predefined tags and opt-in processes.\n\nThe integration intelligently maps key data, including the attendee’s email, phone number, first and last name, as well as booking metadata like start/end timestamps and Google Meet URL. If a contact with the provided email already exists in KlickTipp, their profile is updated instead of creating duplicates. This ensures accurate and up-to-date contact records.\n\nPerfect for businesses that rely on appointment-based workflows and want to automate lead management, event registration, and customer engagement.\n\nRequires active YouCanBook.me and KlickTipp connections and correct configuration of tags, opt-in processes, and custom fields.","url":"16120-manage-new-bookings-from-youcanbook-me-via-klicktipp","usedApps":["youcanbookme","klicktipp"],"usage":9}
