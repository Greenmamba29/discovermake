{"id":17876,"name":"BrowserAct Movie Subtitle Automation","description":"This scenario creates a fully automated movie-subtitle assistant for Telegram.\n\nWhen the user sends a movie name, the bot extracts the title using AI, triggers a BrowserAct workflow to scrape subtitle sources, and writes the results into Google Sheets. Gemini AI converts the movie, language, and row data into a Telegram inline-keyboard JSON. The bot then sends a list of subtitle languages back to the user.\n\nWhen the user taps a button, the callback_data is captured by the scenario. The bot uses the row number to locate the correct subtitle link, fetches the SRT file via HTTP, and sends it directly to the chat.\n\nIncluded steps:\n1. Telegram Watch Updates – receives text or callback queries\n2. Make AI Toolkit – extracts clean movie title or row index\n3. BrowserAct – loads subtitle pages and gathers language links\n4. Google Sheets – stores, searches, and retrieves subtitle info\n5. Gemini AI – builds valid inline-keyboard JSON\n6. Telegram Send Message – displays language list\n7. HTTP – downloads the subtitle file\n8. Telegram Send Document – delivers SRT to the user\n\nThis template is ideal for anyone needing a fast subtitle-finder bot, combining web automation, AI processing, and Telegram interactivity in one workflow.","url":"17876-browseract-movie-subtitle-automation","usedApps":["telegram","builtin","ai-tools","browser-act","google-sheets","json","gemini-ai","http"],"usage":1}
