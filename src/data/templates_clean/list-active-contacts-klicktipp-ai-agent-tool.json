{"id":15965,"name":"List Active Contacts - KlickTipp AI Agent Tool","description":"This workflow component enables the AI-powered Telegram assistant to retrieve a list of active contact IDs from your KlickTipp database. When users request contact lists via Telegram, the AI agent interprets the query and calls this tool to fetch a specified number of active contacts for further processing or review.\n\nThe workflow accepts an optional limit parameter to control how many contacts are returned, with a default of 10 contacts. It aggregates and returns an array of contact IDs that represent currently active subscribers in your KlickTipp account, providing a foundation for bulk operations or contact analysis.\n\nPerfect for database overview, bulk operations planning, contact audits, and segmentation tasks. Users can request contact lists through simple commands like \"Show me 50 active contacts\" or \"List contacts.\" The returned IDs can then be used with other AI tools to retrieve detailed information or perform batch updates.\n\nRequires a valid KlickTipp API connection and configuration as a callable scenario within your AI agent's tool collection.","url":"15965-list-active-contacts-klicktipp-ai-agent-tool","usedApps":["klicktipp","builtin","scenario-service"],"usage":5}
