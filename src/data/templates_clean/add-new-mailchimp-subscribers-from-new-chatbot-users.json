The bot is asking for name, email, company name, company size, and a purpose of the inquiry. \n\nIt's important to pay attention to the scenario schedule and to the filter configuration in the first Chatbot module - both elements need to be the same. If you schedule this scenario to run every 15 minutes then the scenario should only check new users created in the last 15 minutes.","url":"6943-add-new-mailchimp-subscribers-from-new-chatbot-users","usedApps":["chatbot","mailchimp"],"usage":25}
