{"id":17316,"name":"Subscribe Eventbrite orders to KlickTipp","description":"This template integrates Eventbrite with KlickTipp to streamline attendee management. When someone registers for an event via Eventbrite, their details (email, first/last name, event name, URL, and start time) are automatically added or updated in KlickTipp. The workflow applies a predefined double opt-in process and assigns a tag for registrants. If the attendee purchased a ticket (price > 0), an additional \"Buyer\" tag is applied.\n\nThis automation ensures every attendee is captured in KlickTipp with complete event context, segmented correctly for follow-up communication, nurturing, and post-event marketing.","url":"17316-subscribe-eventbrite-orders-to-klicktipp","usedApps":["eventbrite","klicktipp"],"usage":2}
