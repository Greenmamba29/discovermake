{"id":16121,"name":"Manage rescheduled bookings from YouCanBook.me via KlickTipp","description":"This workflow component processes reschedules from YouCanBook.me and instantly updates the matching contact in KlickTipp. When a booking is moved, the scenario captures the new start/end times, Google Meet link, and the person who made the change, then syncs everything to KlickTipp with the tags and opt-in process you select.\n\nMapped fields include the attendee’s email or SMS number (identifier), first and last name, rescheduled-at timestamp, refreshed meeting times, and meeting URL. If the contact already exists, their record is enriched—no duplicates created.\n\nIdeal for teams that need precise calendars, automated reminders, and clean segmentation whenever clients shift appointments.\n\nRequires active YouCanBook.me and KlickTipp connections plus properly configured tags, opt-in processes, and custom data fields.","url":"16121-manage-rescheduled-bookings-from-youcanbook-me-via-klicktipp","usedApps":["youcanbookme","klicktipp"],"usage":2}
