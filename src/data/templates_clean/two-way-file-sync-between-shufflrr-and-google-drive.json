{"id":7360,"name":"Two way file sync between Shufflrr and Google Drive","description":"This template syncs presentation files between Shufflrr and Google Drive.\n\nDon't get discouraged by the complexity of the template - the configuration process is not difficult! You just need to provide target folder IDs and log into Shufflrr and Google Drive.\n\nThe template is scheduled to run every 6 hours. You can change the schedule after you set up the template by clicking on the clock icon on the first module.\n\nA few words about the template:\n1) The template syncs only new files and updated files.\n2) The template does not handle file deletions.\n3) The key between the sources is the file name and modified time. If you change the file name in one system, a new file will be created in the other system. \n4) This template can potentially consume lots of operations and data. Every time the template runs, it refreshes all the files in your target folders.","url":"7360-two-way-file-sync-between-shufflrr-and-google-drive","usedApps":["util","builtin","google-drive","shufflrr"],"usage":16}
