{"id":9130,"name":"Send campaign performance stats from Google Ads in an email","description":"Please disable your ad blockers when working with our Google Ads apps. The ad blockers may cause unexpected behavior.\n\nThis template regularly downloads performance stats from your Google Ads account and sends them as an email. You can use this template as an inspiration for your use cases - you can edit the GAQL query in the third module to get all the columns you need. If you make changes, make sure to also edit the last 2 modules - the text aggregator to cover your new columns and the table headers in the email body in the last module.\n\nThe template is scheduled to run day at 9 AM. You can change the schedule after you set up the template by clicking the clock icon on the first module.","url":"9130-send-campaign-performance-stats-from-google-ads-in-an-email","usedApps":["util","google-ads-campaign-management","builtin","email"],"usage":1226}
