{"id":17887,"name":"BrowserAct Intelligent Supplier Search","description":"This template turns your Telegram bot into a Smart Supplier Locator Bot that helps users quickly find the best offers for any product they want to buy.\n\nWhen a user sends a message to the bot, Make first uses an AI step to understand the intent. If the message is casual chat, the bot asks the user to provide a product name. If it detects a shopping request, it extracts the product keyword and passes it to BrowserAct.\n\nBrowserAct then searches the web, opens the shopping section, and extracts multiple product links and prices from the main results and sidebar. The result is a raw JSON list of potential suppliers.\n\nNext, Google Gemini AI cleans this list. It removes all garbage entries such as Base64 images, thumbnails, or video links, keeps only valid store URLs, and sorts them by price from low to high. The output is formatted using Telegram HTML with a highlighted Best Price and a full list of options.\n\nFinally, the formatted price list is sent back to the same Telegram chat so the user can easily compare all available offers.","url":"17887-browseract-intelligent-supplier-search","usedApps":["telegram","ai-tools","builtin","browser-act","gemini-ai"],"usage":1}
