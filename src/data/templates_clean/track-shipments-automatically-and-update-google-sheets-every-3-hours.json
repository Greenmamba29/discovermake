{"id":17933,"name":"Track shipments automatically and update Google Sheets every 3 hours","description":"Keep your shipment data up to date with this automated tracking workflow using Google Sheets and Ship24. This template identifies new shipments, creates Ship24 trackers for them, and refreshes tracking results every 3 hours for active (non-delivered) shipments. It is ideal for ecommerce sellers, fulfilment teams, and operational workflows where timely status updates are essential.\n\nThe scenario follows two automated routes:\n\n1. Create new trackers\nThe workflow looks for rows where the Last update column is empty, meaning these shipments have not yet been checked. It calls Ship24’s “Create Tracker and Get Tracking Results” endpoint, retrieves the latest tracking event, and updates the row with the tracker ID, current status, and the timestamp of the check.\n\n2. Refresh tracking results every 3 hours\nFor rows that have been checked previously, the template examines the Last update column. If more than 3 hours have passed and the shipment is not marked as “Delivered”, Ship24 is queried again to pull any new events. The Google Sheet is updated with the latest status and a refreshed check time.\n\nBefore you begin\nYour Google Sheet should include at least the following columns:\n• Tracking Number\n• Latest Status\n• Last Update (timestamp of last check)\n• Tracker ID (created automatically)\nAdditional optional columns such as Courier Code may also be included.\n\nThis template was created by Ship24.
